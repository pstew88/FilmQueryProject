##  Film Query Project

## Overview

This program allows the user to pull a list of films and actors from a MYSQL database based on the users input. The user can search by film id or film name.

##Topics

MAMP
SQL Database Query
ORM

## Lessons Learned

JBDC is very picky with what you put in the input strings, and it will not throw a complier error if the information is wrong. Sometimes it wont even throw at runtime and you just have backtrack and trace inputs as to whats wrong.


##How to run

Program runs itself at startup, user then selects to search by id or by a searchWord query. Application runs based on inquiry and terminates when the user selects to end program.
